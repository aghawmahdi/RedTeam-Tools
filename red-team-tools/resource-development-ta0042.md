## Privilege Escalation and Client Execution with <mark style="color:red;">MSFVenom</mark>

### MSFVenom

MSFVenom is a combination of the MSFPayload and MSFencode tools and is part of the Metasploit Framework originally developed by H. D. Moore in 2003. Metasploit is currently owned by Rapid7.

MSFVenom is a payload generator and shellcode encoder MSFVenom is pre-installed on Kali Linux and is available as a part of the Metasploit Framework MSFVenom can be used to generate and encode a wide variety of shellcode payloads for use in exploits to open shells on target machines.

## malicious payload&#x20;

#### Generate a malicious payload for use in exploiting a software vulnerability&#x20;

* Use MSFVenom to generate a payload to obtain access to a remote machine&#x20;
* Use appropriate options based on vulnerability&#x20;

Once generated we will test on a vulnerable application installed on the target machine.
